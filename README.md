## Citing NeuralFoil

If you use NeuralFoil in your research, please cite both the [original code](https://github.com/peterdsharpe/NeuralFoil/tree/master)

```bibtex
@misc{neuralfoil,
  author = {Peter Sharpe},
  title = {{NeuralFoil}: An airfoil aerodynamics analysis tool using physics-informed machine learning},
  year = {2023},
  publisher = {GitHub},
  journal = {GitHub repository},
  howpublished = {\url{https://github.com/peterdsharpe/NeuralFoil}},
}
```

And [the original author's PhD thesis](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/157809), which has an extended chapter that serves as the primary long-form documentation for the tool:

```bibtex
@phdthesis{aerosandbox_phd_thesis,
   title = {Accelerating Practical Engineering Design Optimization with Computational Graph Transformations},
   author = {Sharpe, Peter D.},
   school = {Massachusetts Institute of Technology},
   year = {2024},
}
```
